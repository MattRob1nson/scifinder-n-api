## Running the tutorials

To prepare to run the tutorials, run `npm install`.

After you have run `npm install`, you can run each tutorial individually by entering `node <tutorial-file>`.  For example, `node tutorial1.js`

_Note:_ In tutorials 3 and 4 you need to edit the code to set the client ID to a suitable value.
